# Bouncing-Ball
A Python (turtle) project using concept of Coordinate geometry

Here I use slope of line and angle between two lines or technically two points.

Slope of line parallel to y -axis is infinity.
Slope of line parallel to x -axis is 0.

Angle between two lines is tan(theta)=(m2-m1)/(1-m1*m2)
